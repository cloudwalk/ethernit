# Ethernit

A client for submitting transactions to any EVM-based chain, focusing on
reliability and control.

## What does the name mean?

The name `ethernit` is a portmanteau on [Eternit](https://www.eternit.com.br/),
a well-known brand for old-school, asbestos-filled roof tiles, and
[ethereum](https://ethereum.org/). They have different kinds of products now,
but the name `eternit` is used by brazilians as a replacement to that specific
type of roof tile, much like `googling` is a term for looking stuff up online.
